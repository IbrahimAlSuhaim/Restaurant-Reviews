# Restaurant Reviews App
---

## Project Overview:

In this project we assigned to convert a static **Restaurant Reviews** webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Make it responsive, accessible and available for offline use.

### Getting started

1. Clone the project or download it from https://github.com/IbrahimAlSuhaim/Restaurant-Reviews.git
2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this,

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
4. You will see a map with pins locating restaurants that have reviews.
5. You can filter the result either by neighborhood or cuisine type or both.
6. Click on view details on any restaurant to view reviews on it.
7. You will be directed to restaurant info page which has location, working hours and reviews.
8. Reviews are rated out of 5.
